# Discrete-Simulation-of-Pension-Fund-Reform

This project simulates the impact of various pension reform scenarios on the financial reserve of a Moroccan public sector retirement fund. It uses discrete-event simulation and statistical analysis to evaluate sustainability over an 11-year period.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Simulate 10,000 public employees and 1,000 retirees.
- Analyze 4 reform scenarios:
  1. Retirement at 63 (baseline)
  2. Retirement at 65
  3. Retirement at 65 + increased contribution rates
  4. Retirement at 65 + increased contributions + reduced pension formula
- Measure 7 key financial indicators annually (2025–2035)
- Run 40 simulations per scenario for statistical reliability
- Visualize trends and calculate 95% confidence intervals

## 🛠 Features

- Custom pseudo-random number generator with seed control
- Dynamic population updates (retirements, recruitments, salary growth)
- Pension calculations based on service years and last salary
- Results in tables and graphs
- Cross-scenario comparisons with insights
